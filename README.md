# Emoji Sentiment Classifier using Naive Bayes  

This is my small ML project that classifies the sentiment of a text (positive, negative, or neutral) using emojis.  
The goal was to keep it simple and build something end-to-end that runs in a Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab.

## Features
- Works with short text containing emojis 🙂 😡 😍  
- Uses Naive Bayes for sentiment classification  
- Easy to run and understand (good starter project)  

---

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook: Emoji_Sentiment_Classifier.ipynb  
2. Run the cells (Colab works best, but Jupyter is fine too).  
3. Test the model with your own text.
